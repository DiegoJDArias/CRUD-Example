# CRUD-Example  -- How to implement decorators in Python. Basic.

In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without having to directly change their original code. They are essentially an elegant and efficient way to add extra functionality.

How do decorators work?

A decorator is itself a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some behavior to it, and returns a new function (usually a modified version of the original function). In Python, you use the @decorator_name syntax right before the definition of the function you want to decorate.

Decorators in Python are a very useful tool for adding functionality to functions in a flexible and reusable way. They are essential for writing cleaner, more maintainable, and efficient code. They allow you to modify the behavior of functions without needing to modify their code directly, which makes the code easier to extend and maintain.
