# How to implement decorators and the Observer design pattern in Python. Basic.

In Python, decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods without having to directly change their original code. They are essentially an elegant and efficient way to add extra functionality.

# How do decorators work?

A decorator is itself a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some behavior to it, and returns a new function (usually a modified version of the original function). In Python, you use the @decorator_name syntax right before the definition of the function you want to decorate.

Decorators in Python are a very useful tool for adding functionality to functions in a flexible and reusable way. They are essential for writing cleaner, more maintainable, and efficient code. They allow you to modify the behavior of functions without needing to modify their code directly, which makes the code easier to extend and maintain.

In Python, the Observer design pattern (also known as Publisher-Subscriber) is a way to define a one-to-many dependency between objects, such that when one object (the subject or publisher) changes state, all its dependents (the observers or subscribers) are automatically notified and updated.

# How does the Observer Pattern work?

Subscription: Observers register (subscribe) with the subject to indicate they are interested in its state changes.

Notification: When the subject's state changes, it notifies all registered observers.

Update: Each observer, upon receiving the notification, performs the appropriate action (usually updating its own information or performing a specific task).

The Observer pattern is an effective way to implement a notification system in your code. It helps to keep objects loosely coupled and facilitates the extension and maintenance of your application. Decorators in Python can be useful for simplifying the implementation of the observer pattern, but they are not a central part of the pattern itself.
